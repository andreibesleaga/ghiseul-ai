With Kenya\u2019s growing economy and one of the fastest-growing urbanisation rates in the continent, the demand for housing has never been greater. The Affordable Housing Programme is a priority initiative under the government which is geared towards facilitating the production of decent, safe and affordable housing for citizens of Kenya. Beyond catering to home applicants, the program incorporates supply, demand, and creates an enabling environment through policy interventions. The Affordable Housing Program is delivered though the Boma Yangu platform. Boma Yangu is a platform that connects individuals to the Affordable Housing Program & Housing Fund. It allows individuals to save towards home ownership and makes access to mortgages and the National Tenant Purchase Scheme more accessible online. Allocation of homes is also through the portal. The portal is accessible via USSD, mobile web, and a web portal. Under the affordable housing scheme each Kenyan can only benefit once. Therefore, one Kenyan, one home will be enforced."
