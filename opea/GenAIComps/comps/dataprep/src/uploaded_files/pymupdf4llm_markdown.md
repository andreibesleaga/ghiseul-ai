### Purpose and use of this document


-----

#### This document provides practical
 guidance on establishing and
 strengthening immunization in the
 second year of life (2YL) and beyond. It
 also suggests ways that immunization visits during the 2YL can be used as a platform for delivery of other child- health services. 

###### 1.1  Objectives


###### 1.
To assist countries
in making informed
decisions about
establishing or
strengthening a wellchild visit (or visits) in
the second year of life
that includes vaccina­
tion and other services
as part of a continuum
of care for children.[1]



###### 2.
To provide practical
guidance on planning,
managing, implement­
ing, and monitoring
vaccination services
and improving
immunization
coverage during a
scheduled visit in the
second year of life
that may include other
health interventions.


###### 3.
To provide broad
guidance on catch-up
vaccination for
children older than
one year, who are
delayed or missing
vaccine doses
(“un- and/or undervaccinated”).


1 While this document focuses largely on immunization during a scheduled visit in the second year of life, other health interventions
are addressed to a limited extent. Detailed information on these interventions is beyond the scope of this document. Relevant
publications are included in the Footnotes.

### Introduction to life course vaccination
 with an emphasis
 on the second year
 of life


-----

The Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP),[3] the global blueprint for action in
immunization for the period 2011–2020, calls for the benefits of immunization to
be equitably extended to all people. The Action Plan states that “a ‘life-course’
approach should be taken in order to make the benefits of immunization available
to all those at risk in every age group” and recognizes that “this will mean creating
strategies for reaching individuals throughout their life course and developing
plans for the systems that will monitor and track progress.”

The WHO’s Global Routine Immunization Strategies and Practices (GRISP) document
also identifies vaccination beyond infancy as one of nine transformative actions
that are critical to strengthening routine immunization.[4] It encourages national
immunization programmes to expand scheduled routine vaccination visits beyond
the first year of life and provide needed vaccines in the preschool, school and
adolescent and adult populations. Vaccination opportunities, such as healthy child
visits in the second year of life, preschool preparation visits, and school visits should
be used to assess vaccination status and administer any previously missed doses.
The proper design, distribution, and long-term retention of home-based records
(HBRs) are fundamental to ensure the proper screening and provision of vaccines to
all who are eligible for them.

While many countries already provide routine vaccine doses to children in the
second year of life or later, vaccination after one year of age is expected to increase
in the coming years. A booster dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) containing
vaccine is increasingly recognized as being of public health importance and a
second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) through routine immunization is
recommended in all countries, with many countries scheduling it during the second
year of life. For some vaccines, including pneumococcal, dengue, and meningitis A,
schedule options include one or more routine doses in the second year of life. Some
new vaccines, such as for malaria, will likely be recommended for children over
one year of age. Having an established platform for vaccination in the second year
of life will increase the potential uptake of these vaccines when they are introduced.

However, vaccination is just one of many health interventions that young children
need in order to thrive. As a health service that is often highly used relative to other
interventions, immunization can be a platform to provide other essential services,
such as growth monitoring and promotion, management of common illnesses,
proper sanitation and, in some places, deworming, vitamin A supplementation,
micronutrient supplementation, malaria prevention and care, and HIV/AIDS care.[5]
Interventions to improve growth and development in the first two years of life have
a higher impact than in later years. A scheduled visit during this period is also an

opportunity to provide counselling to parents on nutrition, hygiene, home care
practices, family planning, and timely care seeking.

Many countries already have policies of regular visits for growth monitoring,
promotion, and complementary feeding, but the use of the visits often drops after
one year of age, as families and health workers alike may not view them as a
priority. If managed strategically, vaccination visits in the second year of life (2YL)
can help augment progress both for immunization and other maternal and child
health services.

|BOX 1.|KEY POINTS FOR VACCINATION IN THE SECOND YEAR OF LIFE AND BEYOND|
|---|---|
|1. A n increasing number of vaccine doses are recommended to be given after one year of age as part of a life course approach to vaccination. WHO global recommendations for doses of childhood vaccines to be given after one year of age include a second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) and booster doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis- containing vaccines. Additionally, countries may choose to adopt a “2 + 1” schedule for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in which the third dose is administered in the second year of life. WHO also recommends that doses of some regionally-indicated vaccines, including meningitis A (MenA) in the meningitis belt of Africa and Japanese encephalitis in parts of Asia, can be given after one year of age. 2. T he extension of the vaccination schedule beyond infancy means that the concept of a “fully immunized child (FIC)” indicator must be expanded in the second year. FIC should be specific to the age of the child and the corresponding set of vaccines that the child should have received, as per the national schedule, by that age. Programmes may choose to track FIC in two or more age categories: FIC<1, FIC<2 (see Section 7.1). 3. W ith increasing complexity and duration of the vaccination schedule comes increasing importance of home-based records (HBRs), to remind caregivers of when to return to complete the schedule, to allow providers to screen for needed vaccinations, and to serve as a basis for evaluation through population-based coverage surveys. HBRs must be well- designed, available in sufficient supply for all caregivers, used properly by health personnel, and kept safely by caregivers/families. 4. In some settings, concerted efof rts, including strong communication and health worker capacity-building, are needed to change conventional thinking that immunization is just for infants. If high levels of coverage in||


-----

the second year of life and throughout the life course are to be achieved,
then health workers, caregivers, communities, and partners must have a
solid understanding of why it is important and what they themselves can
do to make it happen. This requires a major shift in thinking and practices
by all parties involved.

5. Whereas children should be vaccinated as soon as they are eligible,

those who are brought “late” should not be denied vaccination. Timely
vaccination is crucial for reducing exposure to vaccine-preventable
diseases (VPDs) but, with a few specific exceptions, it is better to
vaccinate late than never. For 2YL vaccination, the age of 24 months
should not be viewed as a cut-off point after which children are
not vaccinated.

6. Achieving high coverage in the second year of life, even with vaccines

that have long been part of the vaccination schedule, requires even more
attention, visibility and preparation as for introducing a new vaccine,
and should not be taken lightly. The very high MCV1 to MCV2 drop-out
rates observed in many countries attest to the challenges in vaccinating
a new age group. Areas requiring special attention include data
management/monitoring and evaluation, communication, and health
worker capacity building, including supportive supervision and other
forms of post-training support.

7. Data management, monitoring, and evaluation for vaccination in the

second year of life pose particular challenges. Tally sheets and other data
management tools must be updated carefully to correctly capture all doses
administered (even if the doses are not timely) and to encourage proper
health worker screening, recording and reporting of doses administered,
which will be needed to ensure good vaccine management and estimation
of needs. Monitoring progress across at least two birth cohorts and
providing meaningful feedback can be challenging. Careful planning and
learning from experience to date is needed to address these issues.

8. Vaccination in the second year of life can serve as a platform for

providing other essential services to children and mothers. If carefully
coordinated with other programmes, immunization services can reinforce
and stimulate the uptake of other health services, such as growth
monitoring and promotion, nutritional counselling, vitamin A and
micronutrient supplementation, deworming, health education and family
planning, malaria prevention, and follow-up on early infant diagnosis
of HIV/AIDS. Each country must assess the timing and schedules of
these services and determine the feasibility of integration based on an
examination of the human, material and financial resources needed.

###### 3.2  Opportunities and benefits for vaccinating
 in the second year of life

There are several reasons for establishing a strong platform for vaccination and
other interventions in the second year of life and beyond.

###### Increase protection against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) 

The addition of new vaccines, and new doses of existing vaccines, in the second
year of life increases the extent to which children can be protected from VPDs, as
shown in Table 1 below. The provision of additional doses of vaccines that are
already in the national schedule contributes to higher levels of immunity and longer
duration of protection. The immune response to tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine
(TTCV), for example, decreases with age, which is why WHO recommends that an
individual receives six doses (three primary plus three booster doses, one of which
should be given in the second year of life).[7 ]

**TABLE 1.** **WHO-RECOMMENDED VACCINES TO BE ADMINISTERED IN THE SECOND YEAR OF LIFE**

**VACCINE** **WHO RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Second dose of** WHO recommends that a second dose of MCV be added to the routine
**measles-containing** immunization schedule in all countries. Where risk of measles mortality
**vaccine (MCV2),** among infants remains high, MCV1 should be administered at 9 months
**including measles-** of age and MCV2 should be administered at 15–18 months with a
**rubella (MR) and** minimum interval of four weeks between doses. In countries with low
**measles-mumps-** risk of measles infection among infants (i.e. near elimination), MCV1
**rubella (MMR) vaccines** may be administered at 12 months; the optimal age for delivering

MCV2 is based on programmatic considerations that achieve the
highest coverage of MCV2.

8 Both schedule options (3p+0 or 2p+1) are recommended. For countries that have yet to introduce PCV, decisions regarding the

choice of schedule should take into account operational and programmatic issues, including timeliness of vaccination, coverage
expected to be achieved with the third dose, and pneumococcal disease age distribution patterns.


-----

###### Catch-up children on vaccinations that were missed during the first
 year of life 

Vaccination in the second year of life is an opportunity to provide missed doses
of several antigens, including BCG,[9] MCV, oral and inactivated polio vaccines,
pentavalent (or DTP), pneumococcal vaccines, and rotavirus vaccine.

In some settings, families may face various social, geographical, and economic
barriers to getting their children fully immunized by 12 months of age and this
contributes to low coverage. A strong 2YL platform provides an important oppor­
tunity to improve overall protection and coverage. For instance, in a country where
measles vaccine is given at 9 months of age and where a one-year age limit is
enforced, children are by default limited to a three-month window to receive MCV1.
This barrier would be removed by expanding vaccination services to the second
year of life and encouraging catch-up vaccination beyond one year.

Vaccinating children in the 2YL with measles and other vaccine doses missed in
the first year of life contributes to higher levels of population immunity. This was
demonstrated in a 2009 analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from
45 countries. It showed that while pooled routine immunization coverage for
MCV1 by 12 months of age was only about 50%, it rose to over 80% if the doses
given after 12 months of age (i.e. “late doses”) were included in the coverage
estimates (see Figure 1).[10]

-----

###### Create opportunities to integrate vaccination with other health and
 nutrition interventions

A scheduled routine contact with the health system in the second year of life is an
opportunity to further integrate immunization with other health interventions,
such as vitamin A supplementation, nutritional counselling, growth monitoring and
promotion, deworming, paediatric HIV/AIDS care, provision of insecticide-treated
bed nets (ITNs), or family planning. Figure 2 illustrates the potential gains in
coverage for several child health interventions when integrated with the routine
immunization platform in Africa.

###### Make more efficient use of vaccines

Providing two doses of measles-containing vaccine, with one in the second year of
life, can potentially reduce vaccine wastage rates as more doses per opened vial
of vaccine will be given. This may also be true for catching up children with other
vaccine doses that they missed in infancy and are given at a later age.

###### 3.3  Challenges to vaccination in the second
 year of life

Over the past 40 years, immunization programmes have accumulated a wealth
of experience in delivering vaccines, primarily to infants. Since vaccination in the
second year of life has been introduced in many countries, experience has been
mixed. For example, many national programmes assumed the introduction of MCV2
through a new routine visit in the second year of life would be straightforward,
as MCV is already in the schedule in the first year of life and therefore, familiar to
caregivers and health workers. However, reality has shown that it brings substantial
complexity, in some cases of a nature not previously encountered by immunization
programmes. High drop-out rates from MCV1 to MCV2 have been a particular
concern in many countries.

Successful implementation
of vaccination in the
sec­ond year of life
requires strong planning,
coordination, community
mobilization and demand
creation, monitoring, and
support for implementation.


-----

Many immunization programmes still view immunization as a health intervention
purely for infants, and do not offer vaccinations to children over one year even if
they were never vaccinated. While policies must be established for vaccination
beyond one year of age, without proper planning, training, and communication,
these policies will not automatically translate to widespread changes in vaccination
practices. Factors that have been shown to contribute to this situation include:  

 

 
 

- insufficient messaging to front-line health workers on revised policies regarding
provision of vaccination and other health services after one year of age;

- health worker hesitation to vaccinate children >12 months of age with MCV1
because it does not contribute to MCV1 coverage and they may worry about not
having enough doses for the <12 months children;

- lower priority placed on vaccination of older children, compared with
vaccination of infants;

- Insufficient communication and social mobilization to remind and encourage
caregivers to use health services in the second year
of life;

- complexity in recording, reporting, and analyzing vaccine doses given after one
year;

- system barriers, such as limited human resources and uncoordinated supply
chains, for different commodities.

Post-introduction evaluations (PIEs) of measles second dose in several countries,
plus case studies on 2YL vaccination, indicate that the introduction of any
vaccination after the first year of life should be treated as if it were a new vaccine

**complexities of vaccinating a new age group should be adequately accounted**

within the context of a healthy child visit so that it can reinforce the provision of
other health interventions, and vice versa.

Virtually all countries already have in place policies, guidelines, and other
programme supports for child health care through the first five years of life,
including growth monitoring and promotion, nutritional counselling, and
integrated management of childhood illness, among others. Depending on
their health priorities and current vaccination schedule, countries may want to:

###### Assign clear responsibilities for each aspect of preparation. 

Groups or committees that have been established to work on such issues, for
vaccination campaigns or new vaccine introductions, in the past, can be
re-activated. However, if other health interventions are to be included together
with 2YL vaccination, then there should also be representation from other
programmes, such as nutrition, integrated management of childhood illness
(IMCI), malaria, water and sanitation, paediatric HIV/AIDS, etc.

###### Agree on the services or interventions to be provided during the visit and identify the policies, guidelines, and other materials that must be revised. 

These are likely to include the following, in Table 2 below, but there may be
additional materials to revise depending on the country.

**TABLE 2.** **MATERIALS TO REVIEW AND UPDATE FOR 2YL VACCINATION AND SERVICES**


-----

###### 4.2 Deciding on the timing of the 2YL visit
 or visits

A key step is to decide on the appropriate age at which to schedule the 2YL visit
(or visits). This is a function of epidemiological data for the VPDs in question,
plus the schedule for other child health services, as specified by national policies.
Policy- and decision-makers need to consider public health goals and programmatic
issues, using transparent criteria to evaluate their relative importance.

**COUNTRY** **AGES FOR SCHEDULED 2YL VISITS FOR**
**EXPERIENCE** **VACCINATION IN THREE COUNTRIES**

 **One Southern African country decided to provide MCV2 at 18**
months because it coincides with the age for vitamin
A supplementation.

 **A West African country chose to provide MCV2 at 15 months to**
minimize the length of potential exposure to measles virus, even
though the timing was not synchronized with the schedule for
other health services provided during the second year of life.

A South Asian country initially introduced MCV2 and DTP4 at different months in the second
year of life for epidemiological reasons. However, it was later recognized that this added
complexity to the immunization schedule and contributed to missed opportunities for vaccina­
tion. The country then modified the schedule to recommend both doses at the same visit.

National immunization policies and guidelines should be written to clearly
articulate the actions needed by health personnel and caregivers. For example:

        - Clarify that, although it is best to vaccinate children as soon as they become
eligible, for most vaccines there is no upper age limit after which the child should
be denied the protection of vaccination. The exceptions are rotavirus vaccine,
which is not recommended > 24 months of age, and hepatitis B (HepB) birth dose.[14]

        - Convey the intended purpose of the 2YL vaccine doses. If the country is
introducing a second dose of MCV into its routine schedule, then the dose must
be included in the fully immunized child (FIC) requirement, and the dose should
be referred to as Measles 2 or MR2 or MMR2, rather than a booster dose.

14 It is important that programmes have a clear policy on how late HepB birth dose can be administered. Some countries stop

providing HepB birth dose beyond two weeks after birth in order to maintain a four-week gap between doses. However, in
countries using a 4-dose schedule (with combination vaccine), a four-week gap is not necessary prior to the first primary dose
(as the combination schedule meets the dosing requirements), therefore, HepB birth dose can be given up until the day before
the first combination vaccine is due. Both options are acceptable. For more information, see A guide for introducing and
strengthening Hepatitis B birth dose vaccination. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2015
(www.who.int/immunization/documents/general/ISBN9789241509831/en/).

        - Provide clear instructions on how to properly screen children for eligibility by
reviewing HBRs, record doses, report data, and use it for improving services.

        - Specify the actions that health workers should take when faced with situations
that do not represent the ideal, such as children arriving with missing or delayed
doses, children arriving with no HBR, etc. (see Annex 3).

        - Clearly state the policy on vaccinating children who are 12 months or older
and missing doses, during periodic intensification of routine immunization (PIRI)
activities such as Child Health Days (see Box 2 below).

**COUNTRY** **LEARNING FROM GHANA’S**

**The Republic of Ghana’s immunization policy has been updated**
to provide clear guidance to health workers about vaccinating
children older than 12 months of age.

**Second year of life routine immunization policy Additional**
routine contact for immunizations will be done during a child’s
second year of life at 18 months of age or soon after. Services
available at this contact include MR2, MenA, and any intervention
deemed appropriate (e.g. Vitamin A supplementation).

**Catch-up policy All children should be immunized per Ghana’s recommended**
immunization schedule. Children with any missed doses should be vaccinated with
appropriate antigen up to five years of age. During any health visit, a child’s
immunization status should be assessed and missed doses administered per the
recommended catch-up schedule.

**Fully immunized child (FIC) The FIC indicator is split into three categories: FIC by age**
one, FIC by age two, and FIC after age two. A child is considered fully immunized by his/
her age if he/she has received all the age-appropriate vaccines up to that point.

###### 4.3 Catch-up vaccination at any time a child

 has contact with health services 

Sick-child visits and visits to facilities for care of other family members in the
second year of life are also opportunities to catch children up on missed doses
from the first year of life, and to screen and vaccinate them for doses scheduled
for the second year of life.

|BOX 2.|PROVIDING 2YL VACCINATION DURING PIRI EVENTS|
|---|---|
|Periodic intensification of routine immunization (PIRI) activities, such as Child Health Days or Maternal and Child Health Weeks, if regularly conducted, should be used to catch-up children for missed doses from the first year of life and to provide 2YL vaccinations for which the child is eligible. Immunization policies and health worker training for the PIRI should provide clear guidance on this point. PIRI activities should also be used as an opportunity to communicate the importance of immunization in the second year of life and the need for children to be brought for all recommended 2YL vaccinations according to the national schedule. PIRI activities should also underscore the importance of encouraging caregivers to bring the child’s HBR to every health contact. Guidance for health workers on screening, provision of services, and recording of doses, both for the routine 2YL doses and for the PIRI, should be included in policies, field manuals, training, and supervision.

###### 4.4  Coordinating vaccination with other

 services in the second year of life

If it is decided to use the 2YL vaccination visit to deliver additional interventions,
then the planning process must engage representatives from other related
health programmes.

###### Analyse and compare the technical attributes of other interventions
 proposed for the scheduled 2YL visit(s) 

The priorities, objectives, achievements, challenges, and plans of different
evidence-based health and nutrition interventions offered in the second year of
life should be compared systematically to identify both the opportunities and the
limits of a 2YL vaccination contact in reinforcing other services. This may entail
convening a meeting, or meetings, to foster direct communication and negotiation
among stakeholders regarding the continuum of care for young children and the
role of immunization within it.

The package of services to be provided during the 2YL visit should be based on
a combination of technical, managerial, and client-oriented considerations.
Questions to consider in deciding on the components of the package include
the following:

        - What are the established public health priorities of the Ministry of Health?

        - Which interventions can be provided at ages 12-23 months, are any of these
visits already established, and does their timing coincide with a recommended
schedule for 2YL vaccination?

        - Which services, and how many, can be scheduled for a single visit in the 2YL,
and will this improve convenience for the child and caregiver?

        - Can all of the interventions be provided to children through fixed (static),
outreach, and mobile services, and are these service delivery strategies
fully functional?

        - Are the proposed interventions for this visit carried out throughout the entire
country or only in certain geographic areas?

        - How similar are the logistical requirements?

        - What are the implications for human resources, including capacity of staff,
time to be spent per patient, and patient flow?

        - Are sufficient human and financial resources available for providing and
sustaining each intervention proposed for the visit?


-----

Some countries have planned for integrated services that include vaccination
beyond one year of age and have evaluated the experience to identify ways of
improving services. The lessons learned from such experiences can help guide
other countries in their decision-making and planning processes.

|C OUNTRY EXPERIENCE|ZAMBIA’S PACKAGE OF INTERVENTIONS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHY CHILD VISIT AT 18 MONTHS OF AGE|
|---|---|
|O ne year after the Republic of Zambia introduced MCV2, the Ministry of Health and partners reviewed the experience in order to decide how to strengthen performance and integrate 2YL vaccination with other services. A meeting was convened in which ofifcials from several programmes, including immunization, nutrition, and child health, as well as representatives from the HMIS, provincial and district teams, and key technical partners, deliberated on ways in which the 2YL visit for MCV2 could serve additional health needs. A key outcome was definition of the package of services shown below. This reflected, in part, a decision by the MOH to shift its delivery strategy for vitamin A supplementation and deworming away from reliance on Child Health Weeks and into routine services. At 18 months, all children now receive the following: • MCV2 © • catch-up of other vaccinations UNICEF/UN0152973/Schermbrucker that the child missed in the first year of life and for which he or she is still eligible • growth monitoring and promotion • Vitamin A supplementation • deworming treatment (mebendazole). For some children, if indicated, the following are also provided: • follow up/referral on early infant diagnosis (EID) for HIV/AIDS • referral for IMCI or integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) for children with fever or other signs of illness during the visit.||

### Facility-level planning,
 service organization,
 and human resources


-----

The introduction of a scheduled 2YL visit for vaccination requires detailed planning
to implement it within the existing organization and delivery of fixed, outreach, and
mobile services. District and facility supervisors have an important role to play in
adjusting microplanning and reviewing the organization of services, patient flow,
human resources, and prevention of missed opportunities for vaccination.

The national level should provide guidance for updating microplanning templates
and for ensuring high-quality service delivery, especially if there is a preferred
sequence for administering the interventions. Vaccination, as an invasive procedure,
should generally be provided after other procedures.[15] However, the health worker
should complete the interaction with the caregiver by providing guidance on what
to do in the event of side-effects or adverse events, and when and where to return
for the next visit.

###### 5.1 Update microplanning tools and processes

In many countries, microplanning tools currently in use are designed to support
planning for vaccination in the first year of life. To accommodate 2YL vaccination,
microplanning tools must be revised and expanded to include the second year
cohort aged 12-23 months. The target population is surviving infants from the
previous year’s birth cohort. For example, if DTP4 is scheduled to be given to
children who are 18 months of age or older, then the target group for microplanning
for the current year is the number of surviving infants from the previous year.
This information should be available from the previous year’s plans.


**Timely vaccination during a scheduled visit in the second year of life**
**is highly desirable, but the age of 24 months should not be viewed as a**
**cut-off point after which children are denied vaccination. Microplanning**
**should be based on the cohort aged 12-23 months and, even if children**
**are vaccinated later than the targeted age, it does not affect the number**
**or catchment area of the children to be vaccinated, just the age at which**
**they actually receive the vaccines. As further described in Section 7, all**
**doses, regardless of when they are given, should be recorded on HBRs,**
**tally sheets, facility registers, electronic immunization records (EIRs), and**
**monthly reports, according to the age at which the child actually received**
**the vaccines.**

[(www.who.int/wer/2015/wer9039.pdf).](http://www.who.int/wer/2015/wer9039.pdf)


-----

Microplanning should give particular attention to identifying outreach sites that are
convenient for the caregiver(s), bearing in mind that a child in the 2YL is now older,
heavier, and less easy to transport than an infant. Mothers are also more likely to
be working outside the home. To improve access and reduce drop-out rates, the
site selection, day of the week, and time of day for outreach sessions should, where
possible, be decided in consultation with the community members.

The provision of additional health services during the scheduled 2YL visit means
that microplanning should address the operational features of those services as well
as those of immunization. Personnel responsible for nutrition, child health, water
and sanitation, HIV/AIDS, family planning, health education, or other programmes,
should be encouraged to take part in the microplanning process.

###### 5.2 Review the implications for human
 resources for the 2YL visit

Many low-resource countries face severe limitations in human resources so that the
true staffing situation in health facilities falls short of government standards. The
ability to provide multiple services during the visit requires that the right types of
health workers are present at each facility.

During the 2YL planning phase at national level, health officials should review the
actual availability of human resources in health facilities, and provide guidance on
which types of staff can carry out each task. Terms of reference and accountabilities
may need to be revised. At the clinic level, head nurses or facility in-charges
should clearly communicate the sequence of services, both for fixed and outreach
services. They should also designate which staff will carry out specific tasks
(described further in Section 8). These include:

        - screening children to determine which services they should receive that day;

        - providing each service in a pre-defined order: e.g. growth monitoring and
promotion, Vitamin A supplementation, deworming, vaccination, counselling;

        - recording services administered, in all the appropriate tools, immediately after
the services are provided;

        - discussing, with each caregiver, what the child has just received and what
further actions the caregiver needs to take.

In smaller health facilities where one, or few, staff carry out all functions, it is pref­
erable that all health workers at the facility are trained to provide all 2YL services to
ensure continuous service delivery when any members of the team are on leave.


-----

At both fixed and outreach service delivery points, community health workers
(CHWs) or trained volunteers may be able to assist health workers with patient
flow, health education, and possibly some aspects of record keeping. Within the
communities, CHW tasks may include recording newborns, maintaining community
registers of children 0-59 months of age and pregnant women, defaulter tracking
and follow-up, talking with community members about the importance of
vaccination and other services in the second year of life, and informing them of
when and where to seek services.

However, some tasks are less appropriate for CHWs or volunteers. For example,
screening of 12-23 month old children for eligibility for vaccination is more
complex than for infant vaccination, as the number of doses these children should
have received by that age is greater and there may be uncertainty about how
to handle missing or late doses. This is, therefore, likely to require trained
health workers.

In small health facilities with limited staff, it is pref­erable that all health workers are trained to provide
all 2YL services to ensure continuous service delivery when any members of the team are on leave.

should consider the following questions:

vaccination, plus other services, [strategies/MOV/en/](http://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/policies_strategies/MOV/en/)
during the 2YL visit? What, if anything,
will he/she do differently from current
practice on a daily, monthly, quarterly,
or annual basis?

        - What bottlenecks are likely to occur that may result in long waiting times,
especially in high-volume facilities? Clinic supervisors should determine how
to reduce waiting times.

        - In situations where all patients first go through the registration clerk prior to
accessing services, can this step be used to communicate with parents, answer
their questions, and triage children to the different service points? In some
instances, it may be possible to provide certain services at the registration or
waiting area before mothers or caregivers disperse to other departments.
Immunization or other staff may need to be posted to the registration desk
on a rotational basis to assist with this step.


-----

- Are all services proposed to be provided during a 2YL visit for vaccination actually
offered and available on the same days? Missed opportunities for vaccination
and other services arise when not all staff and services are provided at the same
time and place. The added complexity of the 2YL visit may require revising the
schedule for outreach services, to optimize the use of human resources.

- Are policies and practices in place so that all children carry their HBRs and are
screened and vaccinated, as appropriate, when they come for any type of care
(curative and/or preventive)?

Recent country assessments have shown that rates of missed opportunities for
vaccination (MOV) are particularly high during visits in the second year of life.[16 ]

Therefore, it is important to design and organize services in ways that encourage
coordination across different health interventions. Assessment findings further
indicate that only 1-2 visits for preventive care take place during the second year
of life, so there is an even greater need to capitalize on these opportunities. If a
country has conducted an MOV assessment, the findings should be incorporated
into planning to better organize services.

Policies should be put in place to ensure that all children carry their HBRs and are screened and
vaccinated, if needed, when they come for any type of health service.

16 MOV assessments conducted in Chad (2015), Timor Leste (2015), and Burkina Faso (2016) indicated a higher proportion of MOVs

occurring in the second year of life.

### Supply chain management

 other commodities 


# 6


-----

###### 6.1  Commodities needed for vaccination and other services in the second year of life

Planners should review all supplies required for the 2YL visit, both for vaccination
and other services. Any adjustments needed for forecasting, distribution, and storage
should be identified and addressed to ensure that all commodities are available at
each service delivery point. Table 3 presents an illustrative example based on the

the package of services that they intend to include in their 2YL healthy child visit.

17 In general, additional quantities may not be required as these are “delayed vaccinations” of children already accounted for in vaccine

forecast of previous year, not additional doses. However, to cover wastage at field level, countries may consider extra doses for
catch-up based on previous years’ coverages.


-----

Depending on which interventions countries choose to provide along with
immunization in the 2YL, other potential commodities to consider may include:

- preventive zinc supplementation or zinc use in diarrhoea management[18]

- multiple micronutrient powders

- treatments for severe acute malnutrition

- iron supplements

- insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs)

In some countries, commodities such as vitamin A supplementation and
deworming medication are provided primarily through campaign-style activities,
such as semi-annual Child Health Days or weeks that have their own supply chains,
which operate independently of those for routine services. If countries decide to

shift to providing them through an
integrated 2YL visit, then they must
ensure that there are sufficient
quantities at all service delivery points
for routine delivery. In countries where
these commodities are provided to
health facilities as part of essential
drug kits, determine whether the kits
provide sufficient quantities to meet
the needs of 2YL visits.

decides instead to provide DTP4 in the form of an additional dose of pentavalent
vaccine, then the additional cold storage requirements may be minimized and,
programmatically, it will be easier to manage supplies. Using pentavalent vaccine
means that additional doses of hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib),
though not harmful, will be provided without any necessity. This is a decision that
will need to be weighed by the country programme.

###### Catch-up vaccination for doses missed in the first year of life

Many countries already account for some catch-up vaccination using existing
supplies. With the introduction of a 2YL platform and strengthened policies for
catch-up vaccination, it is possible that vaccine and logistics requirements will
increase in the short term; therefore, managers should monitor trends in vaccine
consumption so that they can adjust their vaccine forecasts accordingly. The
potential impact on vaccine and cold chain management of catch-up vaccination
can be estimated based on a combination of factors, including past trend data on
immunization in children over one year of age, the expected number of doses of
each vaccine to be given after one year, and whether the vaccine vials in question
can be used on subsequent days after being opened, as per the multi-dose
vial policy.[23]

###### Other commodities for vaccination

Increased quantities of needles, syringes and safety boxes are required to
accommodate the additional vaccinations to be provided in the second year.
_Section 3.5 of Principles and considerations for adding a vaccine to a national_
_immunization programme. From decision to implementation and monitoring_
provides detailed guidance on this topic.[24]

The quantities of these supplies needed will depend on the estimated coverage for
each dose of each vaccine and this is likely to change over time. In some countries,
the MCV1 to MCV2 drop-out rate was initially high but then fell within a few years,
whereas in others, high drop-out rates have persisted. Programme managers and
logisticians should monitor actual patterns of coverage and vaccine consumption
each year, and adjust their targets and forecasts accordingly.

### Recording, reporting,
 and using data for
 decision-making


-----

The recording, reporting, and use of data at all levels can be the most complex
aspect of introducing vaccination in the second year of life. The target groups to
be vaccinated, or provided with other services, must be clearly defined and
appropriate denominators used to calculate coverage in these target groups. To
determine the data requirement, decisions must be made about the types of
information and indicators to be used to monitor performance and guide action.
Data recording and reporting instruments need to be revised carefully and with
input from end-users to ensure that they promote correct screening for eligibility,
service provision, and recording and reporting practices by health personnel.

This section examines the following topics:


###### 1. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS.
Programmes must
decide how to
monitor introduction
and performance and
how indicators will be
used to guide activities
and decision-making.
They must also
consider alternative
ways of obtaining
programme data such
as through populationbased coverage
surveys or knowledgeattitude-practice
(KAP) surveys.


###### 2. DATA
 REQUIREMENTS.
Once performance
indicators are known,
data requirements
for generating the
indicators can
be defined.


###### 3. UPDATING
 DATA FORMS
 AND SYSTEMS.
This includes all
recording, reporting,
and monitoring tools.


-----

###### 7.1  Performance indicators

A core principle in deciding which changes to make to data management tools and
procedures is that only those data that are likely to be used should be collected.
Countries should be aware that there are certain global immunization indicators that
must be reported on a regular basis. However, other data needs may vary across
countries, depending on programme priorities and problems. Table 4 presents
immunization indicators relevant to establishing or strengthening a 2YL visit.

**Measuring 2YL indicators requires recording and tallying doses administered**
**by the age of administration. In settings where vaccination is known to happen late**
and improving timeliness is a priority, tally sheets can be disaggregated to three
age groups: 0-11 months, 12-23 months, and >24 months. This will enable the
programme to monitor whether timeliness improves over time. A country with a
strong record of timely vaccination may not see this as important and may prefer
that their tally sheets have only two age groups: 0-11 months, and >12 months.

To avoid overloading health workers with reporting requirements, countries should
carefully consider what, if any, additional data will be needed for 2YL indicators
and take the opportunity to review, and possibly remove, indicators not currently
used. On this basis, countries need to decide which data to collect administratively
each year, from all vaccine service delivery points and which data to collect less
frequently through population-based coverage surveys such as Demographic and
Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), or KAP studies. It is
important to differentiate between data collected through each of these methods.

Population-based coverage surveys for routine immunization must be adapted to
capture data for all doses administered. The WHO Vaccination Coverage Cluster
_Surveys: Reference Manual (2017)[25] provides guidance on defining the target_
populations to be surveyed if immunization extends beyond one year of age. For
coverage of vaccines recommended between 12–23 months of age (for example,
MCV2, DTP4), the Reference manual suggests surveying children aged 24–35
months of age in addition to those 12–23 months usually surveyed for vaccines
recommended <12 months.

###### Monitoring drop-out from MCV1 to MCV2

MCV1 to MCV2 drop-out should be monitored at national, subnational and facility
level based on monthly summary reports. Monitoring charts are also encouraged
at facility level. This is complicated by the fact that the doses are scheduled to be

[25 www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/routine/coverage/en/index2.html](http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/routine/coverage/en/index2.html)


-----

given to two different birth cohorts; however, in reality, the actual difference in
size between cohorts for two consecutive years is very small so, for the purpose of
calculating the drop-out, the same denominator should be used for calculating
coverage of both doses. The recommended denominator to use is surviving infants
for the cohort receiving MCV1.[26] A sample coverage monitoring chart including
MCV1-MCV2 drop-out is included in Annex 2.

###### Monitoring if all interventions to be provided during a scheduled 2YL visit are provided 

The 2YL visit is an opportunity to provide multiple services to the same child,
encouraging greater use of services during a vulnerable age. It is important to
have in place a system for monitoring uptake of all interventions provided during
the 2YL visit. For example, if performance for immunization is higher than that for
other services, it could flag obstacles to delivery and could help managers to
identify specific problems and explore solutions. If all services to be provided
during the 2YL visit were recorded in the same register, then facility heads and
supervisors can perform regular spot checks to assess the extent to which children
coming for the 2YL visit receive all of them. On the other hand, recording multiple
services in the same place can result in a large unwieldy register that can quickly
become impractical. The feasibility of these recording practices should be
discussed and tested with health workers. Uptake of integrated interventions can
also be monitored through facility visits, surveys and exit interviews.

###### Determining fully immunized child (FIC)

The addition of new vaccines and new doses of existing vaccines in the second year
of life adds complexity to the health worker’s task of using administrative data to
determine a FIC according to age and the country’s immunization schedule. FIC, as
an indicator, must be specific to the age of the child and the corresponding set of
vaccines that the child should have received by that age, as per the national schedule.

It is increasingly the case that a child should receive 15 or more doses of vaccines
in the first 15-18 months of life. This increases the amount of time the health worker
needs to review the child health card or go through all entries in the register to
determine if the child is fully vaccinated. One option is to split the indicator into two
or more categories (FIC<12 months, FIC<24 months). Alternatively, programmes may
opt not to include FIC in the tally sheets, but rather monitor the indicator(s) through
periodic vaccination coverage surveys.

-----

FIC, as an indicator, must be specific to the age of the child and the corresponding set of vaccines
that the child should have received by that age, as per the national schedule.

###### 7.2  Data requirements

 Determining denominators

For vaccinations scheduled to be given after the first year of life, the best target
is the estimate of surviving infants from the previous year’s birth cohort.
Administrative vaccine coverage can then be estimated by dividing the current
year’s administered doses (numerator) by the estimated number of surviving
children from last year’s birth cohort (denominator).

###### Recording doses administered

Vaccine doses should be tallied in at least two age groups (0–11 months, and >12
months) as a minimum standard or, preferably, three age groups (0–11 months,
12–23 months, >24 months) as a best practice. Examples of tally sheets with these
two alternative age groupings are shown in Annex 1. The creation of additional
subcategories for recording doses, such as service delivery (fixed or outreach),
adds to the workload for health workers and increases the potential for mistakes;
therefore, disaggregating by extra groupings beyond age must be carefully
considered. The ways in which such additional data will be used to guide activities
should be clearly identified in order to determine if it actually needs to be collected.
If required, separate tally sheets can be used for fixed and outreach sessions, and
monthly reporting sheets should have separate rows for fixed and outreach sessions
against each antigen.

Monitoring health indicators by sex has been recommended by some to ensure
equity; however, coverage surveys have shown repeatedly that the child’s gender is


-----

not a barrier for vaccination.[27] Hence, given the added complexity that stratification
places on the administrative system, WHO does not recommend tallying doses
by sex. Similarly, it is not advisable to try to separate doses given to children within
a catchment area versus those outside the catchment area. If concerns exist
about inequalities in childhood immunization, by sex or other characteristics, it
is recommended that when surveys are implemented, they be powered to detect
inequalities or disparities in coverage.

Including three age groupings to record doses addresses the common problem of
how to record late doses of vaccine. If children come for immunization or other
2YL services at 24 months of age or older, they should not be denied vaccination
or other care. Health workers should provide the doses and services and record
them on the tally sheet, HBR, child register, and monthly summary report, in the age
column that corresponds to the child’s age when the dose or services were actually
**received. Country field guides should provide clear instructions and scenarios on**
administering, tallying, recording, and reporting of late doses.

**BOX 3.** **PROMOTING ACCURATE RECORDING AND REPORTING**
**TO IMPROVE SERVICES**

Health workers may be reluctant to record doses accurately if they fear
that they will be disciplined for documenting practices that are not in
accordance with national standards. Proper documentation of actual
practices is essential if problems are to be detected and addressed;
therefore, accurate recording and reporting must be encouraged and
supported. For example, if a first dose of MCV is given after one year of age,
it needs to be recorded as the first dose, regardless of the age of the child.

If health workers feel pressure to report that they have not exceeded
established vaccine wastage rates, they may turn mothers and children
away unimmunized if just one or two children show up for MCV or other
lyophilized vaccines in multi-dose vials that must be discarded within six
hours of reconstitution. Denying these children vaccination on that day
is a missed opportunity for vaccination, prolongs exposure to disease and
risks losing these children from the system for good.

Supervisors have an important role to play in promoting accurate recording
and reporting of data and in supporting health workers with decision-making
when they face less than ideal circumstances.

-----

###### 7.3  Updating forms and health

 information systems

All data collection and reporting instruments should be reviewed and revised, as
needed, to accommodate 2YL data requirements. A user-centered approach to the
design of data instruments should be used to foster proper screening, vaccination,
recording, and reporting of doses. Data recording tools should promote the
key concept that full immunization includes doses given in the second year of life
or later.

As health workers are expected to use HBRs, tally sheets, and registers on a daily
basis, the tools should be designed with their input and formally pre-tested to
**assess how well they are understood and how easy they are to use.**

These steps will help avert problems in recording data or even in vaccination
practices, such as denying vaccination if a child comes late. The pre-test findings
should inform the revision of the tools themselves and strengthen training on
their proper use. Functionality of current tools should be reviewed, on an ongoing
basis, through data quality reviews or assessments,[28] in order to eliminate or revise
aspects that are not being used properly, or at all.

**Engage representatives from HMIS and all programmes involved to develop a plan**
to review and revise the system and to ensure updates are synchronized with the
dissemination of paper-based tools, including HBRs.

Reporting systems should be examined to eliminate duplication and contradiction
among parallel systems (for example, the HMIS and DV-DMT or other vaccinationspecific information systems) in order to avoid increased workload and reduce the
possibility of health worker confusion.

**Prepare a plan with budget, timeframe, and secure funding, for revising all data**
**collection and reporting instruments.**

The plan should designate lead responsibilities, processes for review, timeframe,
quantities required, budget, funding source, and a clear dissemination plan. The
budget should include the costs for printing sufficient quantities of HBRs and all
new forms plus distributing them to all facilities to replace older forms and registers.
All new instruments should be ready in time for training of health workers so that
they can gain direct experience with using them. If electronic immunization records
(EIRs) and other electronic systems are used at health facility level, the changes in

|With immunization extending into the second year of life and beyond, and more vaccines included in the vaccination schedule, it is increasingly important that all mothers or caregivers have HBRs that document children’s vaccination status and provide key information on immunization and health. Immunization policies and health worker training/ supervision should emphasize the importance of caregivers bringing the child’s HBR to health facilities for every visit to screen for vaccine eligibility at any time that a child has contact with the health system. Some countries have introduced immunization status checks at the time of enrolment in primary education (school registration), and caregivers should be reminded of the importance to save the HBR until the © child is enrolled in the WHO education system.||

### Health worker training
 and capacity-building


###### SECTION

# 8

### Health worker training


-----

The success of any health intervention depends on competent front-line health
workers and managers. In health worker capacity-building, “competencies” are
defined as being comprised of skills, knowledge, and attitudes. For vaccination and
other well-child services in the second year of life to be viewed as a priority, health
workers’ interpersonal skills, motivations and attitudes need to be addressed in
training, supervision, and the feedback they are given. Training is essential for
introducing new skills, but must be followed with post-training support to reinforce
skills and improve practices on an ongoing basis.

Representatives from all programmes involved in a 2YL vaccination visit should
contribute to the process of developing the training curriculum. A training
workplan, timeline, and budget for developing the training materials should be
developed so that there is clear, shared understanding of responsibilities and
deadlines for drafting, reviewing, finalizing, and producing the training materials
and any supporting materials, such as slides, job aids, materials for exercises, etc.

Training, supervision, and other means of post-training support should reinforce
policies and standard operating procedures including the core principle that timely
vaccination is ideal but (with few exceptions) late vaccination is preferable to no
vaccination at all.

###### 8.1 Determine required health

 worker competencies

A key step is to identify the competencies required of all cadres of health personnel
involved in vaccination and other health and nutrition interventions in the second
year of life and later. A task analysis or learning needs assessment should be
conducted to clearly identify which staff are responsible for carrying out specific
duties, as noted in Section 5. For a 2YL visit that includes other health services,
trainers should identify the expected tasks and required competencies of:

        - vaccinators;

        - other health care providers involved in an integrated 2YL visit;

        - health facility supervisors or in-charges;

        - community health workers (CHWs);

        - district- or regional-level staff responsible for immunization, child health,
logistics management, data management, and advocacy, communication,
community engagement and social mobilization.

One way to approach this is to list the specific changes to health worker
responsibilities on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis, that result from
introducing vaccination after one year of age.

**BOX 5.** **HEALTH WORKER COMPETENCIES FOR 2YL VACCINATION**

Training and capacity-building for 2YL vaccination must ensure that health
workers can correctly carry out the following tasks.

1. Prepare microplans and forecast commodity needs for reaching an

additional cohort based on a correct estimate of the target population.[29]

2. Screen children properly to determine any vaccine doses needed. This

requires knowledge of the immunization schedule (including whether
there is an upper age limit for any vaccines or doses), the minimum interval
between doses, what to do in case of late or interrupted vaccinations,
how to screen for eligibility if the child lacks a HBR, and whether a child
who has come for curative care can be vaccinated.

3. Communicate clearly with caregivers as follows:

        - When caregivers bring their children for vaccination in the first year

of life, particularly for MCV1, explain the reasons and benefits for

returning for vaccination and other services in the 2YL. Clearly inform

caregivers of when they should return and indicate this on the HBR.

         - During the 2YL visit, thank the caregiver for coming and provide
standard information on the vaccines received, including the fact
that receiving simultaneous injections is safe, and address caregiver
concerns about side-effects.

4. Provide child with other services during the 2YL visit, such as growth

monitoring and promotion, vitamin A supplementation, and deworming
medication, as per national policy.

5. Record and report the doses administered during the 2YL visit on tally

sheets, HBRs, child registers, and monthly summary reports.

6. Identify and trace defaulters so that they complete the vaccination

schedule. This may entail managing and supporting CHWs.

7. Review the facility’s data to assess performance and problem-solve to

address issues related to 2YL vaccination that need attention.

The success of any health intervention depends on competent front-line health workers and managers.

###### 8.2 Prepare the training curriculum

Much of the technical content on proper administration of vaccines and the
provision of other well-child services is already available in existing training
materials. It can be adapted and updated as needed for 2YL training. The curricula
for other programmes that may be integrated with 2YL vaccination, such as
nutrition and child health, should also be reviewed and updated as needed.

New training content should be developed for the 2YL-specific competencies noted
above. These competencies serve as the basis for defining the learning objectives
for the training curriculum. The learning objectives help to focus the training on the
“must know” as opposed to “nice-to-know” content. Learning objectives are also a
useful basis for meaningful pre- and post-test questions.

The use of well-designed pre- and post-tests based on the learning objectives
serves two purposes. First, they give information on the effectiveness of the
training itself and can therefore help identify ways to strengthen it. Second, they
identify areas of limited understanding. This information can then be used to
focus post-training support through supervision, feedback, on-the-job training,
and other means.

The learning objectives for training in the Republic of Senegal, shown below,
address the introduction of a second dose of measles-rubella vaccine. For a 2YL
visit with multiple interventions, the learning objectives for such a training would
need to reflect the competencies described above, as well as for other services to
be provided during the 2YL visit.


-----

|C OUNTRY EXPERIENCE|LEARNING OBJECTIVES FROM SENEGAL FOR TRAINING ON INTRODUCING A SECOND DOSE OF MEASLES-RUBELLA VACCINE (MR2)|
|---|---|
|The training curriculum for the introduction of MR2 in Senegal outlined clear learning objectives. By the end of training, health workers will be able to do the following. • Describe the new vaccination schedule for providing MR2. • Identify the target group for MR2 vaccination. • Correctly estimate MR vaccine needs taking into account MR2. • Correctly fill out all management tools, including the child register, tally sheet, monthly report, stock management record, and vaccination card. • Cite at least three benefits of providing MR2. • Explain to parents at least two reasons why they should retain the vaccination card and return for MR2. • Cite the number of vaccination contacts that a child needs to be fully vaccinated. • Describe at least four tasks for community mobilizers to carry out to support MR2.||


When preparing the training curriculum, it is important to incorporate the use of
adult learning methods. Examples of these methods are provided in the Box 6 below.

|BOX 6.|E FFECTIVE LEARNING METHODS|
|---|---|
|Efef ctive learning in adults occurs when the content is clearly relevant to the learner’s own experience, has immediate application, and clearly serves a practical purpose. Whenever possible, interactive methods that permit the practice of skills should be used. For the 2YL visit, useful interactive methods can include: • skills practice for interpersonal communication, including responding accurately to questions in a manner that fosters trust • h ypothetical scenarios for screening, administration, recording, and reporting of doses (several examples for 2YL immunization are shown in Annex 3). • c ase studies and problem-solving for situations with low coverage of 2YL doses.||


-----

Experience with MCV2 vaccination in several countries has shown that screening,
recording and reporting doses in the second year of life or later can be challenging
because health workers face a wide variety of situations that do not correspond
exactly to the vaccination schedule. Health workers need clear guidance on such
points as:

- how to record a first dose of MCV that is given after 12 months (in a country that
recommends MCV1 at nine months of age);

- what to do when a mother brings the child for the 2YL visit after 23 months;

- the minimum interval between doses; and

- how to implement strategies to reduce pain from multiple injections.[30]

_Annex 3 presents several scenarios that health workers may encounter and suggests_
how they can be addressed directly during training. Annex 4 provides an example
of a job aid to assist health workers to determine the vaccines for which a child is
eligible.

Training also provides an opportunity to address known areas of weak performance.
For example, it can be used to promote the practice of opening a vial to provide
MCV even if only one or two children come for an immunization session. Districtlevel supervisors must support this principle if front-line health workers are to carry
out this practice successfully.

-----

###### 8.3  Plan the training strategy

Planners should develop a training strategy for building the skills of health workers,
their direct supervisors, district health teams, and trainers. Several points should
be addressed:

Identify who will conduct the training sessions and provide them with
thorough orientation on both the technical content and how to train others.

Prepare a detailed training schedule. Work backwards from the anticipated
date for launching 2YL vaccination and take into consideration any other
concurrent events, such as holidays, elections, or vaccination campaigns
that may cause delays.

If other new vaccine introductions are planned to take place in the same
timeframe, it may be possible to combine this with the 2YL training to
improve efficiency.

Time the training so that front-line health workers receive it two to three
weeks before the 2YL launch takes place.

Ensure that printing and/or electronic distribution of updated data collection
tools are available to be used for skills practice during the training.

Print and disseminate other key materials, such as technical guidelines or
operational field guides, job aids, behaviour change communication
materials (see Section 9) and training reference materials, for participants
to share with other staff at their facility.

For longer term, ensure that information is incorporated into pre-service
and continuing education curricula.

Cascade training is often used to reach large numbers of health personnel in a short
period of time. However, the quality of training is known to erode and become
more variable with each level of cascade; hence, it is best to limit the number of
cascade levels to two or three at a maximum. If a cascade strategy is used, the
following tips can help maintain the quality of training.

        - Use the “teach-back” method during the training of trainers (TOT). In this
method, a portion of the TOT time is spent having some participants practice
their skills by simulating a training of other participants, and vice versa.

        - Produce hypothetical scenarios for simulations, with mock history and mock
HBRs, during interactive training sessions. If health workers use handheld EIR


-----

devices, conduct real-life simulations of recording data with the devices and
review the records together with participants.

        - Include some higher-level trainers in the training sessions at the lower levels.

        - Use post-test results of earlier training sessions to adapt and improve the
training for later sessions.

        - Produce interactive DVDs to use at all levels of the cascade to ensure that the
most complex content is addressed in a standardized way. For the 2YL visit, this
would include screening and recording and reporting of vaccine doses given
to children over the age of one year. The possible use of DVDs requires first
assessing whether appropriate equipment for using them is available at all levels.

        - Work with instructional designers to ensure that the teaching methods are
appropriate for training adults.

###### 8.4  Provide supportive supervision and other
 forms of post-training support

A single training session is often insufficient to bring about mastery of new and
complex subject matter. Post-training support is needed to strengthen skills and
practices, both to reinforce content introduced during training and to orient new
staff or those who were unable to attend the training.

**Supportive supervision is a standard, essential method for reinforcing skills.**
However, it requires both reliable funding and transportation, which can be lacking in
many settings. The planning for a 2YL vaccination visit is an opportunity to highlight
the importance of supportive supervision and advocate for adequate levels of funding.

**Prepare an integrated supportive supervision visit checklist for the 2YL visit.**

Countries can adapt their existing supportive supervision checklists to include
specific 2YL questions. These questions can also be asked during informal on-thejob training:


-----

Supervisors should provide written feedback that remains at the facility for
future reference.

Additional types of post-training support may take the following forms.

**Prepare a job aid to guide health workers to screen and vaccinate children that**
have missed doses, are late with vaccinations, or who do not have a vaccination
card. A flow chart or algorithm may be useful for this purpose. Figure 3 provides an
example of a decision-making flow chart adapted from Ghana. The job aid might
also include key messages to assist in responding to common questions or con­
cerns from caregivers or community members. See Annex 4 for another sample job
aid to guide health workers to determine a child’s eligibility for vaccination.

**Develop a poster or job aid on patient flow** to remind all health workers in the
facility, as well as parents and caregivers, how services should be organized during
the 2YL visit. The job aid should particularly emphasize referral between different
departments.

**Prepare a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) so that health workers are**
capable and confident to respond to a variety of questions and situations. Annex 5
contains an example of a FAQ list that countries can adapt.

**Plan for refresher training to take place one to two years following initial training.**

**Provide health workers with a support phone number (e.g. to a supervisor or a**
hotline) and encourage them to call and check if they are unsure how to vaccinate
a child or record a vaccination.

**Explore alternative means of post-training support. Depending upon country**
circumstances, these could include:

- peer exchanges or quarterly review meetings;


-----

                 - a hotline that health workers can use to consult experts when they have questions;

                 - reminder SMS texts or other mobile messages sent to health workers’ phones to
reinforce practices. Text messages can also be used to provide recognition for
correct and timely recording and reporting of data;

                 - in settings where health workers have high access to smart phones, a
WhatsApp group or similar chat application can provide peer-to-peer and regular
supervisory support.

**FIGURE 3.  EXAMPLE FROM GHANA OF AN ALGORITHM FOR DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR**

**MENINGITIS A AND MEASLES-RUBELLA VACCINE**


-----

|BOX 7.|DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR MCV2|
|---|---|
|WHO recommends that, where risk of measles mortality among infants remains high, MCV2 should be administered at 15–18 months, with a minimum interval of four weeks after MCV1. In settings where utilization of health services drops considerably after the first year, ensuring caregivers bring their babies for the second dose at 18 months, for example, is challenging and the risk of drop-outs can be quite high. An alternative approach in these cases may be to stipulate that if a child presents any time between 12 and 18 months, it is better to vaccinate with MCV2 immediately, rather than hoping that they will return again at 18 months. From an immunological perspective, as long as 4 weeks has elapsed their first dose, and they are in the 2YL, then a child is already technically eligible for MCV2. Understandably however, this may cause confusion for health workers, and a policy based on interval rather than strict adherence to a schedule may not work in all settings. Ultimately it rests with the programme to set a policy on this and ensure the proper training and tools are available to health workers to make these decisions. Strategies to reduce drop-outs and ensure that the child returns at 18 months include: 1) providing counselling to caregivers, emphasizing the importance of MCV2 and the time to return; 2) active follow-up through a call or home visit with the caregiver to remind them about the visit; 3) in some settings, providing vaccinations at their home if they do not return at 18 months or soon after.||

### Communication,
 demand promotion,
 and community
 engagement


-----

Communication is an important factor for the success of vaccination in the second
year of life and beyond. A comprehensive, but targeted, communication strategy
that is fully costed and implemented, including a high visibility launch and ongoing
community engagement activities, is key to promoting demand for, and generating
utilization of, 2YL vaccination and other services.

To succeed in building and maintaining confidence in immunization requires a
mix of approaches that focus on building knowledge and awareness, but also take
into consideration the individual, social, and structural/political dynamics that
shape vaccination behaviours. Table 5 provides the key elements of a 2YL behaviour
change strategy to build acceptance and uptake. It lists target groups, key areas
of knowledge, and desired actions to be promoted through communication,
community engagement, and other coordinated programme interventions. This
information serves as the basis for deciding which materials, messages, and
activities are required to promote demand for, and utilization of, 2YL services.

**AND MONITORING** **AND MATERIALS**

These steps are elaborated throughout the following sections.


-----

###### 9.1  Data collection and analysis: understanding your target groups

 Communication plan and working group

A multi-partner communications working group should be convened (or reconvened,
if it already exists for the immunization programme in general) to develop a demand
promotion plan for 2YL vaccination.

Though the plan should address the unique features and challenges of 2YL
vaccination, it should also be aligned and linked with the overall communication
plan for the national immunization programme. This will help ensure that
communication activities, messages and targeting are harmonized and support
the strengthening of routine immunization. The working group should coordinate
closely with others planning the aspects of 2YL to ensure that their work is mutually
reinforcing and technically consistent.

The 2YL communication plan should agree on the key audiences and stakeholders,
communication needs and desired actions by each group, tailoring it from Table 5, as
needed. This information serves as the basis for deciding which materials, messages,
and activities are needed to promote uptake of 2YL services, and accordingly which
data and background information is necessary to shape these efforts.

###### Data collection and analysis

Initial data collection and
analysis is essential to
understand the reasons why
different target groups would,
or would not, carry out the
desired actions in Table 5.

A situation analysis and a
behavioural analysis (for
example, a Knowledge,
Attitudes, and Practices (KAP)
study, or other similar research
activity) can together identify
the barriers that need to be
addressed and the factors that
promote the desired intentions


-----

and behaviours. They can also provide key information to decide how messages
should be worded and the appropriate materials, media, and channels for reaching
each target group. This helps ensure that resources are used effectively and
efficiently. For example, brochures or posters about 2YL vaccination could be found
to be less important to caregivers than having health workers use the opportunity
of the MCV1 visit to provide reminder messages and to note the return date for
2YL vaccination on the child’s HBR. In such cases, resources might be better spent
on health worker capacity-building and the design of the HBR.

Understanding health worker views about 2YL vaccination, including their perceptions
of obstacles and enabling factors, is particularly important. Health workers are the
most frequently cited source of vaccine information, and a recommendation by a
health worker is one of the strongest factors associated with vaccine acceptance.
They have a key role to play in interpersonal communication with caregivers
on the need for, and timing of, the 2YL visit. Information collected on health worker
perspectives about 2YL vaccination should feed directly into the design of the
training curriculum, supervision instruments, job aids, data management tools, and
communication messages and materials.

###### 9.2 Strategic design and planning

 Involvement of key stakeholders

As with any new development in the health system, the engagement of well-known,
credible national level stakeholders is important to focus the public’s attention on
the topic and create trust. For introducing 2YL vaccination or increasing attention
to it, planners should reach out to well-known health officials and trusted political,
community, and academic leaders. Medical associations, schools and daycares, civil
society organizations (CSOs), and NGOs are other influential players whose show
of commitment to 2YL vaccination and other services can encourage appropriate
actions among their constituents and communities. Communication planners
should engage with them, provide them with talking points or other materials, and
jointly identify specific opportunities, such as press conferences, launch ceremonies,
or annual meetings, for demonstrating their support for 2YL vaccination.

###### Community engagement

Depending on the community structures and leaders that are active and functional
in a given area, different types of volunteers or community members have a role
to play in supporting 2YL vaccination. They can be engaged to provide reminder
messages, trace defaulters, and keep community attention focused on the 2YL visit
after it is launched.


-----

District health and community development teams should identify community
networks that are actively functioning and outline a realistic set of steps for CHWs
or volunteers to carry out to support the 2YL visit. Printed reminder materials or
other aids should be developed for this purpose that give information on all
components of the 2YL visit, not just vaccination.

Community members can also assist health care providers to select where and
when to provide outreach services and how to reach the most marginalized or
underserved populations. These are groups for which the risk of non-use of 2YL
services is the highest.

The following checklist can help ensure that all the key steps of the communication
planning process are followed.

|BOX 8.|COMMUNICATION PLANNING CHECKLIST|
|---|---|
| Is there a government-endorsed, multi-agency communications working group in place to support the 2YL visit? Has a situation analysis been completed? Has a behavioural analysis been completed? What messages and materials are required? Has a plan of action (budgeted) been developed? Have you secured funding for the implementation of the plan? Have the communication products/materials been pre-tested? Is there a distribution plan for the materials? Is there a crisis communication plan, including explicitly agreed partner roles and responsibilities, and does it include the relevant elements for 2YL? Have agreed spokespeople been identified and trained?||


-----

###### 9.3 Development and testing of messages
 and materials

 Messages and materials 

All messages and materials should clearly state when caregivers should take their
children for 2YL vaccination and what they can expect to receive during the 2YL visit.

Suggested content of key messages to support 2YL vaccination, tailored to different
audiences, is shown in Table 5. These messages should be adapted and pre-tested
before incorporating them into communication materials, training, or radio or TV
spots. Additional messages specific to MCV2 are found in A guide to introducing a
_second dose of measles vaccine into routine immunization schedules.[31]_

Community networks have a key role to play in supporting the 2YL platform and communicating
the importance of the 2YL visit as part of a continuum of care for the entire first five years of the
child’s life.

-----

**TABLE 6.** **EXAMPLES OF KEY MESSAGE TOPICS TO SUPPORT 2YL VACCINATION**

**AUDIENCE: HEALTH WORKERS**


-----

###### 9.4 Implementation and monitoring

A strong communication plan cannot be successful unless it is fully executed.
This means:

        - the strategic plan must be fully budgeted with funds secured well in advance
of the launch in order to produce sufficient supplies of materials;

        - materials and messages must be translated into the commonly used local
languages as needed;

        - materials must be systematically disseminated to intended audiences at the
appropriate time, in advance of when they are to be used;

        - messages for health worker interpersonal communication with mothers must
be finalized in time for them to be incorporated into training materials, and the
training designed in such a way that permits adequate time for health workers
to practice these communication skills.

###### Formal launch for 2YL visit

Lessons learned from past introductions of MCV2 indicate that it is important to
**conduct a formal launch for the 2YL visit to raise awareness, convey key**
information, demonstrate high-level political and community support from
credible spokespersons, and promote the use of the 2YL services.

The engagement of influential community leaders must begin well before the
launch takes place. They need to understand why the 2YL visit is being introduced,
how it benefits their community, and what actions they can take to support its
success. This engagement should continue on a regular basis, even after the
launch, to ensure that relationships are maintained and that community leaders
are able to continue to advocate for vaccination.

**The 2YL visit should be positioned as part of a continuum of care for the entire**
**first five years of the child’s life. The introduction of the 2YL visit is an opportunity**
to highlight the importance of services that have been available in the past but
have not been fully utilized.

###### Following the launch of the 2YL visit

Communication officials at the national level of the immunization programme
should continue to interact with counterparts at subnational level to monitor the
implementation of the communication plan and to enquire about any issues or
obstacles that may be emerging so that corrective actions can be taken.


-----

###### 9.5 Evaluation and re-planning

In keeping with the overall communication strategy for immunization and child
health, monitoring and evaluation of communication efforts should be carried out
by the working group on a regular basis. Based on the data gathered and reviewed
in Step 1 above, indicators or measures should be established – covering both
process, outcomes, and impact – that can be tracked through implementation of
the various communications and engagement activities. The findings should be
used to inform decisions about the corrective actions to take.

**BOX 9.** **EXAMPLES OF POTENTIAL OUTCOME INDICATORS
**
**TO EVALUATE COMMUNICATION AND DEMAND**
**PROMOTION ACTIVITIES**

              - % caregivers with correct knowledge of the schedule and timings
of when a child needs to be brought for vaccination in the first two
years of life

              - % caregivers who say they intend to fully vaccinate their children,
including the 2YL visits

              - % vaccinators with correct knowledge of the national schedule

              - % vaccinators who consistently and correctly communicate to
caregivers the timing of the infant’s next visit for vaccination,
including the 2YL visits

To evaluate communication and demand promotion activities, it is ideal to carry
out a survey or rapid research exercise targeting caregivers, health workers and,
potentially, community leaders or stakeholders. Such an assessment will provide
a systematic and structured approach to learning about what people know about
2YL vaccination, how they developed this knowledge, what they think it means,
and whether they intend to take the desired actions. The findings should inform
adjustments to communications or demand promotion strategies, so that they may
be more targeted or impactful in future. If resources are not available for a largescale study, then the points raised in Section 10 can be used to understand reasons
for low demand and utilization of 2YL vaccination.

|C OUNTRY EXPERIENCE|RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT IMMUNIZATION AFTER ONE YEAR OF AGE IN TANZANIA|
|---|---|
|U nited Republic of Tanzania’s post-introduction evaluation for MCV2 revealed that many parents interviewed were not aware of the need for further vaccination after their children received MCV1 at nine months. Although children were supposed to attend clinics for growth monitoring after they were one year old, mothers no longer considered it important to come for these monitoring visits. Health officials raised community awareness about the need for vaccination and other services beyond the first year of life through: • broadcasting radio and TV spots; • conducting a seminar with journalists from various local media to get the word out; • conducting meetings on MCV2 with regional primary health care committees; • providing health education about MCV2 to women who attended antenatal and postnatal care visits.||

### Strengthening 2YL
 vaccination performance


-----

###### 10.1


###### Understanding the reasons for
 low performance

If the national immunization programme and partners observe that 2YL vaccination
coverage is low and that the MCV1-MCV2 drop-out rate is high, they should
systematically review existing data and assess the situation to identify key problems
and their root causes. Decisions on how to use resources to improve the situation
should be based on these findings, rather than assumptions that the problem is due,
for example, to low demand or insufficient vaccine supply. A starting point would
be to review the quality of the reported data to determine if it can be considered
complete, timely, reliable, and accurate.

###### At national level, review the geographic scope of the 2YL performance problem. 
If widespread, then examine system-wide factors, including the following.

**1.** Are policies and guidelines complete, clear, accurate, and easy to
understand and use?

**2.** Have policies and guidelines been disseminated systematically?

**3.** Does the training curriculum cover all key points and use effective methods
for adult learning?

**4.** Has the training strategy reached all vaccinators and their supervisors?
Are there any known shortcomings in how it has been implemented?

**5.** Were supervision instruments updated to include 2YL vaccination, and have
they been widely disseminated and used?

**6.** Were data management tools updated, and do they support all aspects
of the policy and guidelines? Did they include input from end-users or
pre-testing to determine how easy they are to use? Have they been
disseminated systematically?

**7.** Has there been a high-visibility launch to focus attention on the introduction
of 2YL vaccination? Was the communication strategy for 2YL vaccination
sufficiently developed, budgeted, and carried out as planned?

If the problem of 2YL vaccination performance is localized to particular geographic
areas, then follow-up with health officials from those subnational/district teams
is necessary, as well as visits to facilities to gain a first-hand understanding of the
problems and their root causes.


-----

###### At subnational/district level, review data to see how geographically widespread
the problem is. If it is widespread, review factors that may affect 2YL vaccination,
including the following.


-----

###### At health facility level, discuss 2YL vaccination with health workers and with

caregivers at the facility and in the community.


-----


Without conducting a major assessment, health managers can add some of the
above questions to their supportive supervision visits and augment them by
conducting exit interviews with caregivers whose children have just been vaccinated.
They can also do exit interviews with mothers who have brought young children
for curative care, or other preventive services, to see if they were screened for


-----

immunization and vaccinated. During supervision visits, district health officials can
talk with community leaders who may provide insight as to the level of awareness
of 2YL vaccination among the community.

Additional guidance on how to integrate a small assessment to strengthen 2YL
performance into a national immunization programme review is included in the
WHO Guide for conducting an Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) review.[32]

During supervision visits, health managers can speak with mothers whose children have just been
vaccinated, or who have brought young children to the health facility for other services, and ask if
they were screened for immunization.

###### 10.2 Taking actions to address the problems

The findings from the reviews described above should be used to decide what steps
to take to strengthen 2YL vaccination. Health managers should convene a discussion
to review the problems and their root causes in order to identify solutions and
develop a plan for implementing them.

_Table 7 presents several illustrative examples of possible actions that programmes_
can take to improve 2YL performance.This list is not exhaustive; rather, it is intended
to stimulate thinking about solutions that can be implemented using existing
resources or with limited additional funds. Furthermore, the most appropriate
actions to take will depend upon a deep understanding of the problems and of the
context in which they occur.

**Annex 3: Scenarios for vaccination in the second year of life**
(for use in training and supervision)

Vaccinators encounter many situations where they are not sure what to do if
the child has missed previous doses, has come late for vaccination, or lacks a
home-based record.

The following are real situations that have been reported from different countries.


**These scenarios are based on a schedule that includes MCV1 at nine**
**months of age and MCV2 at 18 months of age. They should be**
**adapted to fit the appropriate vaccine schedule and country context.**


These scenarios can be used during training for interactive discussions and skill
building for proper screening, administration, recording, and reporting of doses.
In each case, trainers can show just the first two columns, or print out hard copies
of the scenarios and ask training participants to review them in pairs. Afterwards,
discuss as follows.

- Do you think the health worker did the right thing?

- If not, what should have been done differently?

- How could this problem be prevented?

The third and fourth columns are for use by training facilitators and supervisors.
The third column provides the correct response. The fourth column presents some
possible responses that can be further developed and discussed.


-----

**SCENARIO** **HEALTH WORKER**
**“INCORRECT” RESPONSE**


**4.** **Children at one clinic are often brought**
**for MCV1 at 10, 11, 12, or 13 months of age.**

**6.** **A child is brought for MCV2 at 3 years of age.**
**The child has already received MCV1 at 9 months.**

**7.** **A child is brought for MCV2 at 2-1/2 years of age.**
**The child has already received MCV1 at 9 months.**

**8.** **The health worker says that she cannot provide**
**a measles second dose because she has no**
**“MSD” vaccine.**

**9.** **A child is brought for MCV2 at 18 months. The**
**mother does not have a vaccination card but**
**remembers that her baby received MCV1 soon**
**before he started walking.**


**The health worker tells the mothers to come back**
**9 months later for MCV2, believing that it is the**
**9-month interval and not the target age (of 18**
**months) that is important.**

**The health worker does not vaccinate the child**
**because they are older than 23 months.**

**The health worker vaccinates the child but records**
**the dose on a special register so that it is not included**
**in estimates of coverage.**

**The health worker does not provide a second dose of**
**measles to any children.**

**The health worker vaccinates him but records it as**
**MCV1 and tells the mother to come back in one month**
**for MCV2.**


_These scenarios are based on a schedule that includes MCV1 at nine months of age and MCV2 at 18 months of age._


-----

**FOR TRAINING FACILITATORS AND SUPERVISORS**


**WHAT SHOULD THE HEALTH**
**WORKER HAVE DONE?**

**1.** She should have given the vaccine and recorded
the dose as MCV1 in the column of the tally sheet
for “12 months or older” or “12-23 months” and
advised the caregiver to bring the child back for a
scheduled MCV2 visit at 18 months.

**2.** She should have given the vaccine and recorded
the dose as MCV1 in the column of the tally sheet
for “12 months or older” or “12-23 months.” She
should have advised the caregiver to bring the
child back for MCV2 after 4 weeks.

**3.** She should have vaccinated the child and recorded
the dose as MCV1 in the column of the tally sheet
for “12 months or older” or “12-23 months” and
advised the caregiver to bring the child back for a
scheduled MCV2 visit at 18 months.

**4.** She should have advised the caregivers to bring
their children back for MCV2 at 18 months of age.

**6.** She should have given the child MCV2 and recorded
the dose as MCV2 in the column of the tally sheet for
“12 months or older” or “24 months or older”

**7.** She should have recorded the dose as MCV2 on
the column of the tally sheet for “12 months or
older” or “24 months of older”

**8.** She should have provided MCV2 doses to all
eligible children who are over the age of one.

**9.** She should have first checked the child’s age and
vaccination status in the child health register to
ascertain whether the child received MCV1 at or
soon after 9 months.

If no record is found, then the health worker
response was correct. A new vaccine card should
have been provided.

If a record is found, the health worker should have
given MCV2, and transferred the information from the
registry to a new vaccination card.


**HOW COULD THIS PROBLEM**
**BE PREVENTED? (for discussion)**

- Proper training and supervision for immunization

after one year of age

- Well-designed tally sheet

- Job aid to promote correct screening, recording,

reporting

- Proper training and supervision for immunization

after one year of age

- Well-designed tally sheet

- Job aid to promote correct screening, recording,

reporting

- Proper training and supervision to emphasize

that it is better to vaccinate late than to send a
child away unvaccinated

- Well-designed tally sheet

- Job aid

- Training and supervision to emphasize that it is

the age of vaccination that is most important,
as long as there is one month minimum interval
between MCV doses.

- Training and supervision to emphasize that the

need for MCV does not stop at 24 months (no upper
limit – all children need 2 doses of MCV), and it is
better to vaccinate late than to send a child away
unvaccinated

- Well-designed tally sheet

- MOH needs to design the tally sheet to permit

recording and reporting of doses given to children
24 months or older

- Field guide, training, supervision, data recording

forms, social mobilization should use more familiar
convention of numbered doses (e.g. measles1/
measles2, MR1/MR2) for measles or measles rubella

- Field guide should provide clear guidance on what

health workers should do in the absence of an HBR
or record of the child in the health facility register.

**Annex 4: Illustrative example of job aid on screening for vaccine eligibility**

The sample job aid is adapted from Timor Leste (IMMUNIZATIONbasics, 2007) and
is based on a child immunization schedule that calls for BCG and hepatitis B at
birth; Pentavalent, oral polio vaccine (OPV), pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
(PCV), and rotavirus (RV) doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks; inactivated polio vaccine
(IPV) at 14 weeks; MCV1 at nine months; and MCV2, MenA and DTP4 at 18 months of
age. Please adapt this document to match your local immunization schedule.

This, along with other 2YL tools and resources, can be found at
[www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/policies_strategies/2YL/en/](http://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/policies_strategies/2YL/en/)

###### Instructions:


**Step 1:** Praise the parent or caregiver for bringing their child for
vaccination today. Find out from the child’s immunization
record or the caregiver:

1. How old is the child today?

2. Which vaccines has the child already received?

(Check the home-based record or child register)

**Step 2:** Use the chart to the right to decide what to give. The child
should already have received all vaccines due up until their
current age. If they are missing doses, it is not too late.
Administer the vaccines for which they are eligible, respecting
the necessary spacing (see far right column).

**Step 3:** Remind the caregiver when to bring the child back for the
subsequent doses due. Take this opportunity to emphasize the
importance of receiving the complete series of vaccines for
the child to be fully protected.


† In certain situations, MCV can be given from 6 months of age. This dose should be considered a zero dose (“MCV0”) and two subsequent doses
(MCV1 and MCV2) should still be provided according to the national schedule.

**Annex 5: Frequently asked questions about vaccination in the second year of life**

The following questions can help health workers respond to questions about
vaccination in the second year of life or later.

**1.** **Why is it important to vaccinate children after their first birthday?**

Both the level of protection and the duration of immunity are increased by
providing additional doses of vaccine after the child has reached one year of
age. This means that older children will continue to be protected from many
vaccine-preventable diseases.

For measles, a second dose ensures early protection of the individual child
and also reduces the rate of accumulation of susceptible children and the risk
of an outbreak.

**2.** **Which vaccines, and at what age, should children receive vaccines after**
**the first year of life?**

 This depends on the schedule of the national immunization programme in
each country.

   - WHO has recommended that all countries provide a second dose of

measles-containing vaccine after one year of age. Many countries schedule
it in the second year of life.


   - WHO also recommends a booster dose of vaccine containing diphtheria,

tetanus, and pertussis, to be given in the second year of life.


   - Other vaccines that may be scheduled between 12-23 months include

those against meningitis A, Japanese encephalitis, typhoid and yellow fever.


   - Many countries also recommend catch-up vaccination to provide doses of

vaccines missed in the first year of life.

**3.** **Are there some vaccines or doses that should not be given to a child in**
**the second year of life or later?**

Vaccination in the second year of life is an opportunity to increase the level
and duration of protection against vaccine preventable diseases. If children

[34 Available at: www.who.int/immunization/documents/positionpapers/en/](http://www.who.int/immunization/documents/positionpapers/en/)


-----

are missing doses of certain vaccines that they should have received in the
first year of life, in general, it is better to vaccinate late than never. There are
certain exceptions as indicated in the national immunization schedule and
noted in WHO position papers.[36] These are:

   - Birth doses of hepatitis B vaccine should be given only in the newborn

period, as stipulated in the national policy.

   - Rotavirus vaccination after 24 months is not considered necessary because

of the age distribution of rotavirus gastroenteritis.

**4.** **On what occasions should a child over one year of age be vaccinated?**

   - When they come for a scheduled vaccination visit according to the national

immunization schedule

   - Any time they are in contact with the health system, including if they come

for curative care. Mild illness is not a reason to deny vaccination to a child,
and screening sick children for immunization eligibility is a standard
component of IMCI. If children have been brought for growth monitoring
and nutritional counselling, this also provides an opportunity for screening
and vaccinating them. Another opportunity for screening and vaccination
is if the child has accompanied one of their family members, such as a
sibling or mother, coming for care.[35]

   - During a scheduled Child Health Week, or other similar campaign or event

in which catch-up vaccination is provided.

**5.** **What messages should the mother or caregiver be given during their infant’s**
**last vaccination contact before reaching one year of age?**

For most children, the measles contact is the last vaccination visit before the
child reaches one year of age. During that visit, the health worker should
make sure to inform the mother as follows.

   - It is important for her child to come back at the scheduled time

[depending on the national vaccination schedule] to receive the remaining
doses of vaccine to be given in the second year of life. Unlike in the past,
the child cannot be considered fully immunized until they receive these
recommended vaccine doses as well.

35 For more information, refer to the WHO missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) strategy. Available at:

[www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/policies_strategies/MOV/en/](http://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/policies_strategies/MOV/en/)


-----

- These additional doses will provide stronger and longer-lasting protection

against important childhood diseases. With additional doses, this
protection will last beyond early childhood.



- Be sure to keep the home-based record, such as vaccination card, in a safe

place and bring it the next time they come for vaccination, and any time
they come to a health facility for services.



   - She should bring her child for vaccination at the next scheduled time

[specify the date]. However, if she is unable to come at that time, to come
as soon as possible thereafter.

**6.** **If a child comes for services substantially later than the scheduled time,**
**should they still be vaccinated?**

Yes. While timely vaccination as soon as the child is eligible is highly desirable
to reduce potential exposure to disease, it is always important that the child
receive protection from vaccination and not be sent away if they come for
vaccination late. With very few exceptions, as explained in Question 3 above,
it is “better to vaccinate late than never”.

**7.** **If a child comes late for the 2YL vaccination visit and they are older than**
**23 months, should the dose be recorded as given in the second year of life**
**(12-23 months)?**

   - Always record and report the dose accurately so that it corresponds to the

age at which the child actually received it. This will depend on how the
tally sheets and monthly reporting forms are designed.

   - If they contain two age groups (“0-11 months” and “over 12 months”), then

record the doses as being given “over 12 months”.

   - If they contain three age groups (“0-11 months”, “12-23 months”, and

“24 months or over”), then record the doses as being given at “24 months
or older”.

**8.** **Is it safe to vaccinate children after one year of age? Are there any**
**additional risks?**

It is safe and there are no additional or different risks to vaccinating children
after one year of age compared with vaccinating them during infancy.


-----

**9.** **What other services or care can the child receive when they come for**
**vaccination in the second year of life?**

   - Growth monitoring and promotion, nutritional counselling, advice on

hygiene and sanitation, and, depending on national policies, vitamin A
or deworming medication can be provided during a visit for vaccination
in the second year of life.

   - Some countries may decide to provide additional services, such as

follow-up on early infant diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, or family planning services
for mothers.
