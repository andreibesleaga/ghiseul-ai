# GENIE.AI
This repository contains code and resources of the GENIE.AI framework - a purpose-built platform designed to empower public institutions to rapidly design, deploy, and manage custom Generative AI solutions—such as chatbots, digital assistants, and content generation tools—at low cost, with full control, and without external dependency.

- ​​Fully open-source and interoperable technology stack, aligned with [GovStack](https://specs.govstack.global) digital public infrastructure standards, enabling seamless integration with the broader ecosystem of digital public services.

- Modular and adaptable architecture, featuring a customizable UI, hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, and support for agentic and tool-calling capabilities.

- Dockerized deployment optimized for Kubernetes, ensuring scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance.
- Developed based on input from a multi-stakeholder working group and built on the [Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA)](https://opea.dev).​

### Objective: 
Empower governments and institutions with a free, open-source, modular stack of software and tools to create tailored, scalable, and context-specific GenAI and RAG applications and conduct reference implementations of solutions addressing selected public sector use cases. 

The reference implementations shall:
- Match commercial performance at a lower cost
- Be tailored to public sector data and needs
- Simplify configuration and maintenance
- Adhere to relevant AI and software standards and best practices
- Seamlessly integrate with the broader digital public infrastructure

### Context:
The [UN Secretary’s General Roadmap to Digital Cooperation](https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/) outlines a plan for a safer, more equitable digital world. Developed based on extensive consultations with international stakeholders, the Roadmap identifies eight key areas of action, including “Promoting Digital Public Goods (DPGs) to create a more equitable world” and “Supporting global cooperation on artificial intelligence.”

Developing open-source AI for the public sector, grounded in common principles and transparent standards, can serve as a pivotal DPG. This approach can significantly facilitate access to and use of AI technology by public sector institutions, while also promoting international and cross-government cooperation on AI.

Many public sector entities encounter significant obstacles when trying to adopt off-the-shelf generative AI applications. These include administrative challenges, data privacy and ethical concerns, high licensing costs, and issues of control and configurability. At the same time, the ability to leverage AI technology safely and effectively is becoming increasingly important to boost efficiency and deliver better services to citizens, particularly in developing regions where access to essential public goods and services is still limited.

An open-source generative AI solution, compliant with internationally agreed-upon principles and standards, would address these challenges. It would promote global digital cooperation and advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals, ultimately leading to more efficient and equitable service delivery across the globe.

### Scope: 
The GENIE.AI initiative involves:
- Defining, testing, and documenting technical specifications;
- Developing reference implementations for selected uses cases;
- Collecting and curating data for testing and fine-tuning; 
- Development of custom benchmarks that reflect public-sector needs for performance evaluation;
- Pilot implementation of solutions in 2-3 developing countries. 

### Relevant use cases: 
A non-exhaustive list of public sector use cases for GenAI and RAG has been collected by a [multi-stakeholder working group on Open-Source Generative AI for Public Services](https://osaips.atlassian.net/wiki/external/ZjA2MjBhMWM1NDQ4NDFhY2EzNTRiYjZjMWNjNjI3NjQ) and is accessible [here](https://osaips.atlassian.net/wiki/external/OTMzYWQ2MWJlYWRmNDk3ZjkwZWYyOWFiYzQzNzQwM2I).
